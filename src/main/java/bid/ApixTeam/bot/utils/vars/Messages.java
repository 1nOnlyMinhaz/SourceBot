We moved on from Dyno pretty quickly, but up until this bot was released, we have always used Mee6. Now of course it's a good bot with some perks, but we could do better. So we did. We, the ApixTeam, consistent of yours truly, Alw7SHxD, and Andrewboy159, have created a bot that has been in the making for months on end. We are proud of what we have created. We hope all of you users also are proud of what has been made specifically for this server that we all love.";
